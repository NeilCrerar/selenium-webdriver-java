# selenium-webdriver-java
Code from Udemy course "Selenium Webdriver with Java" at:
  https://www.udemy.com/selenium-webdriver-with-java-testng-and-log4j/

Repo originally created as basic shell directly on GitHub then cloned into Intellij where setup SDK and other basic
structure so will see how it goes.

Udemy course recommends using Eclipse IDE and instructions are geared towards that but use Intellij at work so using
that for this course and potentially use Eclipse if work on another machine at any point.
